# LifeTracker  
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/bb45FsmpgPs
#### Description:  
"LifeTracker" is a modern and simple web application that helps you organize and track different parts of your daily life — your mood, productivity, expenses, notes, and tasks — all in one place.

It is built with Flask, SQLite, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project was created as my final project for CS50x 2025, combining what I’ve learned about backend development, frontend design, and database management.

## Overview

I wanted to build something practical that could help me and others stay organized and aware of how each day goes.  
LifeTracker allows users to:

- Create an account and log in securely  
- Track their daily mood and productivity  
- Add and manage tasks with deadlines and priorities  
- Write and pin personal notes  
- Record expenses and visualize them on a chart  
- View all data together in the Life Stats dashboard  

Each feature is connected so users can see their progress and patterns over time.

## Design Decisions

I wanted LifeTracker to feel simple, modern, and easy to use.  
- Flask was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility.  
- SQLite was used because it is lightweight and works perfectly for small projects.  
- Bootstrap ensures a clean and responsive design.  
- Chart.js was added to create a dynamic expense chart.  
- The color palette and layout were designed to look modern and friendly.
